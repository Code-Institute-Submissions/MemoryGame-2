# Memory Game
Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project for Code Institute. This game was created for the purpose to demonstrate both potential future employers and tutors skills acquired during my study at Code Institute. 

# Demo
A live demo can be found [here:](https://pilecki.github.io/MemoryGame/)

# UX
The purpose of the game is stimulating memory as well as providing fun for the players. According to research playing memory games help to enhance concentration and memory. 
A primary aim in creating the design was the simplicity. On the main page, only the necessary information is provided.

A user's expectations are:
1.	As a user, I want everything to be cleared so that I could discover content quickly.
2.	As a user, I want to know the rules so that I could know how to play the game.
3.	As a user, I want to have different difficulty levels so that I am not be bored quickly.
4.	As a user, I want information summarising the game so that I know how the game went.
5.	As a user, I want a stopwatch showing how much time left so that I know when the game finishes.
6.	As a user, I want to see beautiful pictures, so that the game is enjoyable.

**UX testing**
- As a user, I want everything to be cleared so that I could discover content quickly.
    - The game is contained on a single website. The information provided is reasonably placed and well-sized.
- As a user, I want to know the rules so that I could know how to play the game.
    - After the webpage is loaded, a user receives information on how to play the game.
- As a user, I want to have different difficulty levels so that I am not be bored quickly.
    - There are three buttons placed under the game rules where a user can choose one of the three levels of difficulty.
- As a user, I want information summarising the game so that I know how I game went.
    - At the end of the game, a player receives information whether he wins or loses.
- As a user, I want a stopwatch showing how much time left so that I know when the game finishes.
    - When the level of the difficulty is chosen, the stopwatch appears on the screen informing the player how much time left to end.
- As a user, I want to see beautiful pictures, so that the game is enjoyable. 
    - The developer delivered beautiful pictures of London landscapes as well as outstanding images of Greece.

A website was manually tested on various mobile devices(iPhone5,6,7, Ipad, Fire 10 HD, Samsung Galaxy, Sony Xperia) and multiple web-browsers (Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 

After the page is loaded, the name of the game is seen in the navbar part. 
Instructions on how to play the game are placed in the middle of the website. 
Under the game rules, three buttons are giving to the user the possibility of choosing the difficulty of the game. 
After one of the buttons is clicked, twenty pictures are loaded.
The user has three seconds to memorise where the given picture is. After this time all pictures are hidden and the user has to match all the pictures. Depending on what level is chosen, the user has limited time to finish the game.
At the end of the game, the user receives the summary of the game.
